The purpose of a digital signature created using GnuPG is twofold: Authentication and Integrity.

1. Authentication (Validating the Sender):
The signature proves that the message originated from the holder of the corresponding private key. Since only Alice (alice@example.com) should possess the private key for the ID AD84A65CF39254F7D9FD3AB2D23FD503007219FA, verifying the signature authenticates her as the sender.

2. Integrity (Ensuring Message Content is Unchanged):
GnuPG uses cryptographic hashing to ensure the message content has not been altered since it was signed.

Verification Confirmation:
When decrypting the message, GnuPG automatically checks the signature against Alice's public key, resulting in the following success message:

------------------------------------------------------
gpg: Signature made 11/27/25 23:01:02 Georgian Standard Time
gpg:             using RSA key AD84A65CF39254F7D9FD3AB2D23FD503007219FA
gpg: Good signature from "Alice <alice@example.com>" [ultimate]
------------------------------------------------------

The "Good signature" status confirms that the message's cryptographic hash matches the signed hash, proving both the sender's identity (Alice) and that the message content is intact.
